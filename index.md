I am a third year Data Science student. I take STATS220 as it is a requirement for my degree :D

## My Meme
My meme is just a simple joke inspired from the game of Valorant and I made it using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

## Meme explanation
My current favourite game is Valorant and so I used it as inspiration for my meme. The pictures I used is one of the most popular characters in the game, Jett.
1. The first row depicts a sad Jett, corresponding to the text which just simply means that your gaming partner/duo is at the bottom of the leaderboard.
2. The second row depicts a happy Jett, corresponding to the text which simply means that your gaming partner/duo is instead at the very top of the leaderboard.

## R code
Below is the R code I used to create this meme.
